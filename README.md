# reprabhala.github.io

As my personal portfolio, this is a way for me to showcase my projects.

# To create your own github.io portfolio/blog:
1. Create a repository with the format "<yourgithubaccountname>.github.io". It is essential that your repository name matches your github account name for this to work well. 
  For example : my repositor name is "reprabhala.github.io" while my github account name is "reprabhala".
2. Clone the created remote repository to your local system. (use either a terminal, github desktop or sourcetree)
  If using a terminal use the command : git clone <repo url>
3. Enter the project folder in your local system and add in your changes in a html file. You can test these changes in your local browser before committing them.
  If you are not familiar with adding html changes refer to : https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages or you could also look up templates          online.
4. Push and commit these changes to see your github page live. This can be accessed by typing your repository name in the browser.
